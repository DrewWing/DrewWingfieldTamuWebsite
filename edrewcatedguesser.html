								<h2>Origins</h2>
								<p>
									In late September of 2023, I started a spreadsheet that took data from FTCScout and organized it.
									It was event-specific, meaning we had to create a new spreadsheet for every competition, and it required manual input of match schedules.
									But it's biggest flaw was that FTCScout would crash during compeition, as many other teams also used FTCScout.
								</p>
								<p>
									So, I decided to add features. I imported each team's Offensive Power Rating (a measure of a team's scoring potential) and attempted an early version of match outcome prediction.
									It was still very klunky, inaccurate, and relied on FTCScout.
									I then decided that I could remove FTCScout from the process, grabbing team and match data from the FIRST API directly and calculating OPR myself.
								</p>

								<h2>Current Status</h2>
								<p>
									The project was <a href="github.com/DrewWing/EDrewcatedGuesser">released to GitHub</a> on Christmas day, 2024. I wrote all 200+ commits and ~6k lines of code by hand (I don't use LLMs or other "AI" tools because licensing gets weird).
									<br>
									The current release is a beta version (v49.0) because - while functional - it still lacks a few key features and bug fixes. 
									I hope to find time to release a v50.0 sometime this semester.
								</p>

								<h3>Current Goals:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Iron out bugs</li>
									<li>Linux support</li>
									<li>Local spreadsheet support (no need to use Google Cloud worker, Google Sheets, etc)</li>
									<li>Potential FRC support</li>
								</ul>
